# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

**The gist**: build a digital version of the classic childhood game where each player counts down from three and plays their move. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock. Draw if the same.

RPS is a good learning project because the rules are simple but present nonetheless. The idea of three competing elements and determining which one wins out is common in many games.

## Mock-Up

While not particularly thrilling, here's a version of RPS I made that uses the arrow keys for input for rock, paper, or scissors.
