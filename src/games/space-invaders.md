# Space Invaders

**The gist**: build a game where you move a ship left and right while shooting at grids of enemies above that dive bomb at the player.

_Space Invaders_ is a great single-screen game to clone for learning because it's got action, simple AI, and enough wiggle room to expand on it by introducing different enemy types, power-ups, etc.
