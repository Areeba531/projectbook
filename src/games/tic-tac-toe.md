# Tic-Tac-Toe

**The gist**: build a digital version of Tic-Tac-Toe (a.k.a. Noughts and Crosses, Xs and Os).

Tic-Tac-Toe (TTT) a traditional paper-and-pencil game for two players. One player plays Xs, the other Os. They alternate turns placing their shape in a 3x3 grid. The first two connect three in a row in any direction wins.

## Mock-Ups

The game board and assets can be as simple as four lines and the O and X graphics:
