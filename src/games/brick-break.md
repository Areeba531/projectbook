# Brick Break

**The gist**: build a game where you control a paddle and bounce a ball of it to break up bricks displayed in a grid.

Also known as _Breakout_ and _Arkanoid_.

## Reference

Here is a screenshot of the arcade version of _Breakout_:

## Specs

- When the ball hits a wall, bounce it off
- When the ball hits a brick, destroy it and bounce the ball
- When the paddle hits the ball, bounce it back
- Level is complete when all bricks are destroyed
- If the ball goes past the player, it's game over

## Concepts

- Collision detection
- Velocity

## Extra Credit

- Sound effects when the ball hits anything
- Give the player multiple lives by having the ball respawn 3 times before game over
- Render bricks in different patterns
- Add power ups that appear when certain bricks are destroyed
- Keep track of scoreâ€”destroying multiple bricks before hitting the ball with the paddle again could be a combo
