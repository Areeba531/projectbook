# Controller Tester

**The gist**: build a "game" that renders the current input of all of the connected controllers.

If you're building a game with controller support, it can be immensely helpful to have a visual representation of what the various inputs for a given controller are. This project has you detecting connections and rendering what's currently being pressed or moved.
