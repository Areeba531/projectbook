# Horde Mode

**The gist**: top-down game where waves of aliens swarm towards a colony of people.

Aim is to see who can get the highest score and last the longest. The game should get more and more difficult with each wave. There could be different weapons and upgrades.

Interesting aspects to me are the top-down nature, controlling with mouse and keyboard, enemy AI, building out the map, and making the game feel good.
