# 2D Platformer

**The gist**: build a game where you run, jump, and dodge enemies while trying to reach the end of a level.

## Concepts

- Level editor usage
- Level design
- Game design for challenging enemies

## Extra Credit

- A fun alternative to this idea is an auto-running platform where the only input is to jump. This works especially well for mobile devices where input for precise platforming is slightly limited.
