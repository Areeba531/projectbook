# Website Builder

## The Gist

Build out a web app that lets users create simple web pages graphically with no coding knowledge. This allows people to build web pages with a variety of content to meet their needs.

Blocks to start with:

- Header
- Text
- Image
- YouTube Embed

Ideally blocks would be able to be reordered within a given page.

The selected blocks for the page would get persisted in a database associated with the user's site.

And then, finally, that page would be able to be rendered and viewable in the browser.

## Scope

This is an entire app! It's large in scope. It'd really have a lot going on. The web interface for building. The renderer. The data model for the blocks. The user and site with (minimal) management.

## Concepts

There's so much here!

- Defining a data model for the blocks, which is decently complex
- Storing the built pages which have a pretty complex data model
- Building a complex UI
- Rendering a complex page from stored data that needs to be processed properly
