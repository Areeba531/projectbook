# Linkbud

A web application for building out a simple list of a links for a given profile. This is useful for people linking to various profiles on social media, sharing an album on multiple streaming services, or even serving as a simple home page for someone.

Users should have the ability to:
- Sign up / sign in
- Create a list of links with a name
- Add, edit, delete, and reorder links on their list
- View their list publicly

## Concepts

- Authentication
- Authorization (access control) -- public vs private
- A non-trivial UI 
- Data modeling
- Rendering a web page from user entered data

## Wireframes

## Stretch Goals / Extra Credit

- Email verification if signing up via email
- Sign up / sign in via a third-party service like Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc.
- Add description with a rich text editor or Markdown support to lists to give more context
- Display icons for links to common locations like YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, etc.
- Support multiple lists
- Customize the list's display with a photo, colors, font, etc.
- Support deleting a list or making a list private
- Ensuring the URLs are properly formatted
- Sanitizing input for potential non-safe data
