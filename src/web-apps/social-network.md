# Social Network

**The gist**: Allow users to sign up for an account and author simple text-based updates with a maximum length of 256 characters and follow other users to see their updates.

It's debatable how much of a "social network" this project is. It's more of a social microblog. But a lot of the foundations becomes present when you have the ability to follow other users and aggregate various updates in a timeline.
