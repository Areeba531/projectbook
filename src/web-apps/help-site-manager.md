# Help Site Manager

I think an open source tool for a company to build out and manage their Help site would be really rad and fun to build. It's more specific than a [Content Management System](./content-management-system.md), while also having a lot of the similar needs.

## Specs

- Admin area with accounts to manage the articles
- Ability to add, edit, and delete articles, which likely have a title and body
- Rich text editor for adding screenshots and a variety of text
- Public facing website for viewing the articles
