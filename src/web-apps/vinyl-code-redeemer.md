# Vinyl Code Redeemer

The Gist: users can enter a code they received with their vinyl purchase to download the digital version of the album.

Does not, of course, have to just for music downloads. Could be any digital file.

This is a nice app for learning in that it can be pretty simple but expanded to be quite complex.

Name idea: Redeemy; would make a potentially useful open source app for someone to deploy and host themselves!

## Features (Basic Ver)

- Web page for redeeming a code
- If the code matches what you hard code in the back-end, then download the file

## Feature (Complex Ver)

- Build out an admin for musicians to sign into to upload their albums
