# Web Comic Platform

**The gist**: build a web app that makes it easy to upload, share, and read the pages of a web comic.

Web comic creators often create the pages of their comic and then publish them online one page at a time. Maybe they publish them in batches or have a vertically scrolling comic with multiple images. Wordpress with a plugin has been a long-standing way to handle this, but like a lot of Wordpress plugins, it feels pretty tacked on.

The idea here is to build an publishing platform specifically tailored to those making web comics by making it easy to have multiple comics, each with many posts, which contain the images of the comic.
