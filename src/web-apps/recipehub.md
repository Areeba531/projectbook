# RecipeHub

GitHub for recipes! Open source recipes. But for food, not software.

## Specs

- User accounts (authentication)
- Recipe management
    - Data model for a recipe:
        - Name
        - Description
        - Ingredients
        - Instructions
- Viewing another user's recipes
- Fork a recipe (make a copy to edit and adjust to your liking)

## Extra Credit

- Favoriting another user's recipes
- More metadata like prep time and cooking time (and thus total time)
- Image upload for a recipe
- Tags for things like vegan, breakfast, etc.
- Private vs public recipes
