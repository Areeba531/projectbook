# Contributing

Do you have ideas for projects that'd make a good candidate for those learning how to code? Additions by the community are more than welcome!

Did you work on a project inspired by the book? Add links to your source code to the project to help others.

Did you find a friggin' typo? Jeez, I'm sorry. A fix would be more than welcome.
