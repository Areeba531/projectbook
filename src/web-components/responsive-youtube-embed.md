# Responsive YouTube Video Embed

This is a really simple little project and component. It's basically just a way to take a YouTube video and embed it in a resilient way that can be responsive since that tends to be an issue when it comes to their default embed. It usually requires a CSS snippet, but it'd be nice to not need that. 

Also, it'd make it possible to take the YT video URL or just the ID and render it accordingly.

Could support the various embed options too, like whether or not to have cookies. Starting at a certain time, etc.
