# Video Player

I picture this as building a UI for dealing with a video, a lot like YouTube's or Vimeo's player. It would allow you to pause the video, change the volume, scrub to a specific timestamp, and make the video fullscreen.

The native video player is fine in most operating systems and browsers, but that doesn't mean more functionality couldn't be added.
