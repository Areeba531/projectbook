# Product Page

**The gist**: code a website promoting a product you care about.

If you're looking for an idea for a website with a bit more focus, build out a page for a particular product you're fascinated with. Maybe it's a video game console or type of cereal. I don't know what you're excited about. I'd probably make a website dedicated to the core reasons why Saltines are underrated crackers. But that's just me.

A page specifically meant to feature a product will require you to think a bit more visually to really sell it. While the other website ideas are about building out basic content structures, a product page has a goal! Sell the product.

## Spec

- Introduction to the product
- Images of it

- Detailed specifications
