# Press Page

**The gist**: build a website that summarizes a game (or really any product) for the press.

The game dev community has this fantastic tool called [presskit()](https://dopresskit.com/) by Rami Ismail. It's a fast way to build a website with no cruft that specifically targets members of the press. It has a clear navigation for sections of the page, media for the press to use, and the ability to call out key information.

[View an example for the game _Octodad: Dadliest Catch_.](https://younghorsesgames.com/press/sheet.php?p=octodad_dadliest_catch)

While its usage has spread throughout the game dev community, I think this would be useful for any piece of software or significant project. Having an excellent summary page that loads quickly is really helpful. For an app, it could include screenshots, brand assets, a video demo, etc.
