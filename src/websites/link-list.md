# Link List

A Link List is a website that's just a list of links. Pretty simple! It's useful as a simple homepage or landing page for someone to use to collect all of their profiles online. I also call them Link Trees and Link-in-Bio websites.

A Link List is an ideal candidate for a learning project because it's simple (only one page and a few elements) and it's actually useful. You could build this and host it and actually use it for your own needs.

Here's a screenshot of https://brettchalupa.neocities.org — a Link List I build for myself as an example.
