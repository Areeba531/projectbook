# Websites

What follows are ideas for websites that you could build that don't require any back-end. This means there's no need for a database or a server to manage the requests. These are great ideas for getting started with web development by focusing on HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript, and some templating.

## Starting Out

You'll need an editor and a browser! That's it. That's part of the joy of building software for the web. There's not too much you need. Start with editing HTML and CSS directly. Don't worry about content management systems like Wordpress or creating themes or templates. Start with the basics and go from there.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a commonly used and free editor. I'd suggest starting there.

With these projects, you'll learn about semantic structure, organizing information, making it look nice, and adding some light interactivity.

## Resources

Once you're comfortable with the bare basics of HTML and CSS, the best resource is your web browser's Developer Tools for inspecting the source and seeing how other sites do it. Any website that loads in your browser has source code you can look at to understand the elements being used and the styles that are applied to it.

### Hosting

I'd start with [Neocities](https://neocities.org). It's a free website host where you can build simple websites and share them with others. It's fun, got a good interface, and won't bog you down with a bunch of extra stuff, which is great when you're just getting started.

Other options that are also free and pretty friendly to use:

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify

### Static Site Generators

When you're building more complex websites beyond just a few pages, a static site generator (SSG) will be massively helpful for sharing page HTML across reuseable templates, authoring content in something other than HTML, and organizing the content.

There are _so_ many static site generators that it's pretty exhausting. The nice thing is that they usuall y don't require you to know another language aside from whatever templating language they use (usually an extended HTML language).

Here are some of the ones I've used:

- [Jekyll]
- [Hugo]
- [Zola]
