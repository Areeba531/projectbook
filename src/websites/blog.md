# Blog

**The gist:** Create a blog where you write your posts by hand.

Blog is short for web log. It's a way to write updates, like a journal, and publish them online. While fancy blogging platforms exist like Wordpress that handle managing the content and rendering the HTML that readers load, you could, you know, just write it all by hand. That's what this project is!

## Specs

- Home page that lists your blog posts
- Write multiple blog posts in HTML
- Share styles across pages with one CSS file

## To Consider

- How's writing the content directly in HTML?
- What's tedious about managing all of the posts and URLs directly? What if you wanted to change the layout of every post?
