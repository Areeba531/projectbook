# Custom Markup Language

There are a lot of these, like TOML, YAML, Markdown, etc. But it'd be fun to write your own. There are lots of other markup language project ideas in here, so this is one of many.

You'd want to:

1. define the spec
2. write out some examples
3. build code that can read it and load it and do whatever with it
