# Text Editor

Building something like `nano`, `pico`, or similar that opens a file into a buffer and allows you to navigate it and edit it.

This is a bit of a dream project, as I don't have much of a clue as to how to go about this. This is part of why it's appealing.

## Spec

- Start the program
- Receive input to type characters
- Move cursor to edit document buffer
- Save document buffer to disk
- Load a file from disk
