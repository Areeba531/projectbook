# File Sync

**The gist**: Basically Dropbox.

This is a complex project that would be challenging and 

Would have many aspects:

- File storage location
- Client tool that manages downloading and uploading, w/ GUI to manage this process
- Server tool that keeps track of files; likely with web GUI too

## Concepts

- Comparing files
- Sharing files across the network
