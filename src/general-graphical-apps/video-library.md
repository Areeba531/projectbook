# Video Library

**The gist**: build an app that allows people to organize and play their video files.

I'd call this app VidLib!

## Specs

- Load video files from a directory into library
- Add files to the library
- Render the videos in a grid with their filename and a frame from the video
- Tap a video to play it
- Keep track of status
    - Unplayed
    - Started
    - Finished
- Allow videos to be resumed where they left off if Started but not Finished

## Extra Credit

- Keep track of
- Support as many video file types as possible
- Ability to specify metadata for a video (title, cover, genre, year, director, etc.)
- Folders or tags for organizing things by show, director, genre, etc.
