# Vector Design Tool

**The gist**: build a vector editor that allows shapes and text to be rendered on a frame.

This is a complex project that I'm not even sure where I'd begin. But it's pretty interesting to me because I'd love an open source, cross-platform alternative to Sketch for designing logos, icons, apps, and web pages.
