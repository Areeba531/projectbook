# Window Manager

**The gist**: build a desktop app that allows users to easily control the layout of multiple windows.

One of the true desktop-only apps in _Projectbook_, I'm really interested in building out this idea as an open source desktop app. There are lots of options out there for this, but it seems approachable while being challenging.

The program would allow users to use shortcuts to specify the size of windows and their location on the screen. For example, on a Mac, <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>â†’</kbd> would move the window to take up the right half of the screen.
