# General Graphical Apps

The following projects are apps that require a graphical user interface (GUI). They're platform agnostic, so whether you want to build an app for Android phones or Linux desktops, hopefully you'll find something to dig into.

While you could certainly build web applications for these projects, there's something different about building desktop and mobile apps that's appealing.
