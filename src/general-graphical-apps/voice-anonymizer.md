# Voice Anonymizer

**The gist**: build a desktop app that taps into mic input sources and obfuscates the voice.

I'll be honest. I don't even know where I'd start with this project. But it'd be an interesting challenge. The UI would be extremely simple: turn the feature on or off. When it's on, input that's shared via Zoom or whatever would be deeper or digitized or changed in _some_ way to make it less clear whose voice it is.

## Concepts

- Input manipulation at the OS level
- Sound manipulation
