# Time Tracker

**The gist**: build an app for tracking the amount of time spend doing a given task.

## Specs

- Start a session with a name/note
- Track time until it's stopped
- Allow sessions to be resumed
- Allow past sessions to be viewed

## Extra Credit

- Allow sessions to be grouped by type (time spend studying, programming, reading, etc.)
- Total up time for a day or week spend on a given type of session
