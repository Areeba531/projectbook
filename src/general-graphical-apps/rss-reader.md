# RSS Reader

**The gist**: parse an RSS file, display the entries, and allow users to read them.

## Concepts

- HTTP
- Polling
- Data storage
- Rendering details

## Stretch Goals

- Refresh feeds on intervals
- Keep track of read articles and only display unread ones
- Support podcasts or make a podcast variant, as podcasts are just RSS feeds with audio
