# Chat App

**The gist**: build an app that let's two or more people chat with instant messages in a room.

In the days before Slack and Discord there was IRC and AIM for chatting with friends (and strangers too). It was a stable of my time on the computer growing up. I've never built a chat room or instant messaging app before, but I'd like to. There are certain challenges with it, like ordering messages, sending and receiving, and storing all of the data.
